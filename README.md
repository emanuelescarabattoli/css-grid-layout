# Bootstrap like column system
You can define how mutch space a column will take just by using the `col-*` CSS class.
Take a look at this example:
```
<div class="grid">
  <div class="col-2">
    A column
  </div>
  <div class="col-4">
    Another column
  </div>
  <div class="col-1">
    Very small
  </div>
  <div class="col-5">
    Large column
  </div>
</div>
```
